## Product Description

The Gold Extractor is a trading algorithm that tracks and analyzes the price of gold in relation to bond yield changes and USD strength. It aims to identify potential trading opportunities by monitoring these factors and executing trades accordingly.

The algorithm uses historical data for gold prices, bond yield, and USD strength to calculate the correlation between gold and bond yield, as well as the overall strength of USD. Based on these calculations, the algorithm determines whether to sell gold and buy USD or vice versa.

The Gold Extractor provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to trigger actions using key presses. By pressing 's', users can sell gold, while pressing 'b' allows them to buy gold. Similarly, pressing 'u' triggers the selling of USD, and pressing 'd' triggers the buying of USD.
